                        <h2>The exteme philosophy</h2>
                        <i>If you want to get a sense of our business philosophy, all you have to do is
                        pick up a slice. There’s no better testament to “Dedication to Quality, Commitment to Innovation” than the pizza itself.</i>
                        <p>Our dedication to quality comes from a strict policy to use only the freshest ingredients, the tastiest combinations of toppings, and a mouth-watering store-baked crust. As for the innovation side of things, well that’s easy. Think about it. What does an office full of freethinking, pizza connoisseur daredevils get you? It gets you mandarin oranges, Canadian bacon, pineapples, mozzarella, and cheddar (Paia Pie). It gets you black beans, grilled chicken, olives, onions, cilantro, and cheddar (Baja 1000). And for the politically savvy pizza-eaters, it gets you homemade hummus in place of tomato sauce, tomatoes, olives, feta, fresh basil, pepperoncinis, and mozzarella (Peace in the Middle East). This is the sort of pizza invented by people who sail from kites, who snowboarded before there were snowboards, and who learned to always color outside the lines.

                        At Extreme Pizza, we’re always experimenting with new ways to test the palette, to push the pizza experience to a higher level. And because we’ve received such raving support from our customers and food critics, we have made the sky our limit as to what we can create on our canvas crust. Whether you eat at Extreme, have a piping hot pie delivered to your doorstep, or try one of our “take-n-bake” pizzas that you cook at home, you’ll need to gear up for an eating adventure. Are you ready to get extreme?</p>
